Erin,Find Another,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024","Found a better vitamin with New Chapter which is just as good (you only have to take 1 a day) and its significantly cheaper. The price on this one literally increased $20 over night when I had it in my cart (from $50 to $70!). I've been using it for years for every pregnancy. Still love how my body feels when I take them, although it always used to give me an unpleasant after taste. I wonder what the flavored version is like. I won't try it until they get their prices back down.",N/A

It’s annoying to have to take so many, but I noticed if I took more than one at a time- I don’t get queasy which was really easy for me to be the whole time I was pregnant. 10/10 would recommend!!",N/A
Teresa,MORE STOCK COMING SOON!,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2024","I love these vitamins. I’ve been taking them ever since my first pregnancy in 2019 and I’ve kept taking them because I’ve noticed they make a difference compared to other prenatals when it comes to my energy levels as well as my hair and nails.

I reached out to Garden of Life’s customer service and they said that they expect more stock at the end of March/beginning of April. High demand and unexpected supply chain issues have made these unavailable from many retailers, but these prenatals are still in production and should be available again at their regular prices soon.",5 people found this helpful
THN,"Great Product, Supply Issues Annoying",,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2024","I have been using this since my last pregnancy and am trying to continue, but am losing patience with the recent supply issues and am on the verge of looking for another brand. The product itself is excellent in terms of composition of vitamins and you just need to take another omega 3's supplement. More recently, however, I've noticed that it is always out of stock on Amazon. If I can't access it, I can't take it and I don't have the bandwidth to keep checking online. I am breastfeeding and can't afford to go a long time without pre/post-natals",N/A
Toni M,"Great product, insane price hike",,"Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2024","I love love love this product. I used it for two pregancies, one a single and the other twins. Delivered happy, healthy, brilliant babies. Another bonus was I didn't experience the nausea I felt with the pharmaceutical prenatal vitamins. Loved it so much I went back to it about a year after I stopped nursing just for me, after noticing my energy levels were not keeping up with 3 toddlers. And just like that I was back in the game full of energy again. After all the bottle read for mother and baby, and I was a mother trying to keep up with her babies. Not to mention the perk of healthy long hair and nails. I can go on about this product for days.

Now, that price is ridiculous. The price has gone up 3× the amount in the last year. There is a difference between inflation and greedy. The product is great. It sells itself and I know I can't be the only one that recommended it to friends, loved ones, and total strangers. Then you hike the price up on us. A shame and a pity is what I call that. I'll wait for the price to drop. I always have an extra bottle because it's that good.",2 people found this helpful

I feel peace of mind knowing that I'm using a prenatal that is all-natural and has ingredients that I can understand and pronounce.

Abbie M.,Best Prenatal I have tried!,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2024",I am currently in my third trimester of my first pregnancy. I was very sick in the beginning and having a hard time finding a prenatal that I could stomach. Many of the others I tried had a nasty taste or caused me to burp them up hours after taking the vitamin. These do not have a taste or smell and have no burp up affect after the vitamin has been taken. I will continue to take these for the rest of my pregnancies. The quality of the vitamin is top notch I also like how it has Folate instead of Folic Acid a better form for the pregnant mother to be taking. I am confident my baby and my body are getting all the nutrients they need in this pregnancy.,3 people found this helpful

The only thing I wish they would do differently is use organic ingredients since non-organic is now well researched. But it was a better option than synthetic! They did have a product that was more organic, but it had an herb in it that was used a contraceptive so I went with this option. Please make an organic version!",2 people found this helpful

Alyssa,These made me so sick,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2023","I was told this was the gold standard of pre natals on the market so I felt confident in my purchase. This is my first child so I didn’t know what to expect with first trimester morning sickness. I thought I was having a realllly bad first trimester. Terrible headaches everyday, terrible constipation, sick to my stomach, nauseous, tired, muscle aches and my mental health was being flushed down the toilet. A few weeks ago I got so sick one night that I decided to take a break from my vitamins for a day and to my surprise, all of my symptoms subsided substantially. I decided to skip the next day to see what would happen and felt even better. I don’t know if it’s because Nestle bought this company over and has tampered with the quality/ingredients or not. But I do know I spent two months very sick and didn’t need to. I started a new prenatal that next day and no negative symptoms have returned. I would not buy this product. Do your research on how little concern Nestle has for new mothers. Wish I could give 0 stars.",2 people found this helpful

K. F.,Love these vitamins!,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023","I used to take One a Day and after my pregnancy blood tests came back with low iron results, I switched to this brand. These vitamins helped get my iron to normal levels and I now have a very healthy 4 month old! I’ve been also taking these postpartum and I feel like I haven’t had some of the postpartum symptoms like hair loss and it could be due to the vitamins, but not sure. These vitamins made my nails stronger and grow faster that’s for sure - my nails used to break all the time and were very brittle and thin. I don’t take the full dose 2 instead of 3 per day, and it has still worked great. I have these on a subscription now, I love them so much.

One thing I feel like I have to say — you absolutely MUST drink lots of water any time you take vitamins with iron. If you continue taking these after giving birth, you need to get a laxative, or else be prepared for the most painful poop of your life. It will bring you to tears. Just trust me.",5 people found this helpful

HoneyD3w,Good Quality,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2023","These vitamins definitely were a great addition to my health regimen. Before I started using this my vitamin readings were very low, and I was suffering from Alopecia. I believe in working from the inside out so I decided to give these vitamins a try before considering steroid treatment. Well after almost a month of use, I first started noticing better nail growth, and not breaking so easily. Then one day I realized my hair had gotten thicker and longer; before, it was thin and sluggish. It has been filling in slowly. My last checkup had much better results from the lab work and I wasn't so deficient as before. My recovery has also improved after bike riding, with the boost in vitamins, so I would say these are great even if you're not trying to conceive! I can definitely say after my own use that good vitamins make a world of difference in my life.",18 people found this helpful

CaitlinKH,Turned hard and black??,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2023","I’m not sure how to feel about these, besides totally freaked out. I researched a ton of natural prenatals and came upon this one and figured it was a safe choice; I used to take Garden of Life probiotics and always had trust in the brand. But these have thrown me off. I took the whole bottle over a couple months, I was down to the last 5 or 6 and noticed one with black like burnt almost sludge on a corner. So I tossed it out without thinking. Then went to take another one and noticed it looked darker than usual… so I popped open the brand new bottle that I had auto delivered and noticed for sure that the new bottle pills were super light and the remaining ones of the old bottle had turned darker and actually felt hard when I squeezed them. So that plus that were black sludgy one has me freaked out. If anyone from the company can reach out and let me (and the rest of the reviewers saying similar things) know that this is normal, or what the explanation is, I’d appreciate it.

Hannah Elizabeth Rhodes,A pregnancy ESSENTIAL- Non-GMO & Gentle on the Stomach,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2023","I can't sing enough praises for Garden of Life Prenatal Vitamins. These little gems have been my go-to companion throughout my pregnancy journey, and they've truly exceeded my expectations.

One of the standout features of these vitamins is their gentleness on the stomach. Unlike some other prenatal vitamins I've tried, these never caused me any discomfort or stomach aches. It's such a relief to have a product that supports my health and my baby's development without causing any unnecessary discomfort.

The comprehensive nutrient profile of these vitamins is another major win. Knowing that I'm providing my body with all the essential nutrients needed for a healthy pregnancy gives me peace of mind. From folate to iron and beyond, Garden of Life has covered all the bases to support both me and my growing baby.

Perhaps the cherry on top is the fact that these prenatal vitamins are certified non-GMO. In a world where quality matters, it's reassuring to know that I'm consuming a product that meets the highest standards of purity and sustainability.

In conclusion, Garden of Life Prenatal Vitamins have been an integral part of my pregnancy wellness routine. They're gentle on the stomach, packed with vital nutrients, and proudly certified non-GMO.

Some make me constipated, some gives headaches, some makes me nauseous and i just have no had these issues with this one. it is pricey but it also feels like a good quality prenatal. i also buy these to have on hand especially since i am TTC and have been for so long and this one for sure will be one that i add to my monthly shopping list.",3 people found this helpful

Trista,Don't recommend for those this bad morning sickness,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023",Garden of Life is my go to brand for vitamins so when I found out I was pregnant I immediately bought these. I vomited them up everytime I tried to take them. They were way too hard on my stomach. Not to mention you're supposed to take 4 of them throughout the day so I was pretty much constantly nauseated. It's just too much when you're likely already experiencing a sensitive stomach. But I gave them to my friend and she likes them so gave them some stars back for credit since some women can miraculously stomach these. Just would not recommend for those of us who have a lot of upset stomach from baby.,One person found this helpful

The smell and taste are unpleasant, so I would recommend taking these while holding your breath or with some juice. You also have to take three per day, which isn’t a big deal once you get into the habit of it. Nutrition is super important during pregnancy, especially if you have morning sickness and unable to eat a balanced diet. I highly recommend these!",10 people found this helpful

jab296,AMAZING results to help with menstrual issues,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2023","I am 37, and starting about 5 or so years ago I started having regular spotting or bleeding between my cycles, as well as bleeding after intimate relations, which got so bad the past 2 years or so that I was basically spotting or bleeding every day all month long almost every month. I began taking these daily, and noticed slow but steady improvement within a month. Within 3 months, my bleeding and spotting between periods was all but gone! I have been taking these regularly for a little over a year, and any time I slack on it by going too many days without taking it in the month, the spotting comes back. I usually only take 2 a day, sometimes one, but that is enough. This vitamin is seriously amazing.

Toni M,"Great product, insane price hike",,"Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2024","I love love love this product. I used it for two pregancies, one a single and the other twins. Delivered happy, healthy, brilliant babies. Another bonus was I didn't experience the nausea I felt with the pharmaceutical prenatal vitamins. Loved it so much I went back to it about a year after I stopped nursing just for me, after noticing my energy levels were not keeping up with 3 toddlers. And just like that I was back in the game full of energy again. After all the bottle read for mother and baby, and I was a mother trying to keep up with her babies. Not to mention the perk of healthy long hair and nails. I can go on about this product for days.

Now, that price is ridiculous. The price has gone up 3× the amount in the last year. There is a difference between inflation and greedy. The product is great. It sells itself and I know I can't be the only one that recommended it to friends, loved ones, and total strangers. Then you hike the price up on us. A shame and a pity is what I call that.

Many of the others I tried had a nasty taste or caused me to burp them up hours after taking the vitamin. These do not have a taste or smell and have no burp up affect after the vitamin has been taken. I will continue to take these for the rest of my pregnancies. The quality of the vitamin is top notch I also like how it has Folate instead of Folic Acid a better form for the pregnant mother to be taking.

A few weeks ago I got so sick one night that I decided to take a break from my vitamins for a day and to my surprise, all of my symptoms subsided substantially. I decided to skip the next day to see what would happen and felt even better. I don’t know if it’s because Nestle bought this company over and has tampered with the quality/ingredients or not.

K. F.,Love these vitamins!,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023","I used to take One a Day and after my pregnancy blood tests came back with low iron results, I switched to this brand. These vitamins helped get my iron to normal levels and I now have a very healthy 4 month old! I’ve been also taking these postpartum and I feel like I haven’t had some of the postpartum symptoms like hair loss and it could be due to the vitamins, but not sure. These vitamins made my nails stronger and grow faster that’s for sure - my nails used to break all the time and were very brittle and thin. I don’t take the full dose 2 instead of 3 per day, and it has still worked great. I have these on a subscription now, I love them so much.

One thing I feel like I have to say — you absolutely MUST drink lots of water any time you take vitamins with iron.

Then one day I realized my hair had gotten thicker and longer; before, it was thin and sluggish. It has been filling in slowly. My last checkup had much better results from the lab work and I wasn't so deficient as before.

But these have thrown me off. I took the whole bottle over a couple months, I was down to the last 5 or 6 and noticed one with black like burnt almost sludge on a corner. So I tossed it out without thinking. Then went to take another one and noticed it looked darker than usual… so I popped open the brand new bottle that I had auto delivered and noticed for sure that the new bottle pills were super light and the remaining ones of the old bottle had turned darker and actually felt hard when I squeezed them. So that plus that were black sludgy one has me freaked out.

These little gems have been my go-to companion throughout my pregnancy journey, and they've truly exceeded my expectations.

One of the standout features of these vitamins is their gentleness on the stomach. Unlike some other prenatal vitamins I've tried, these never caused me any discomfort or stomach aches. It's such a relief to have a product that supports my health and my baby's development without causing any unnecessary discomfort.

The comprehensive nutrient profile of these vitamins is another major win. Knowing that I'm providing my body with all the essential nutrients needed for a healthy pregnancy gives me peace of mind. From folate to iron and beyond, Garden of Life has covered all the bases to support both me and my growing baby.

Perhaps the cherry on top is the fact that these prenatal vitamins are certified non-GMO. In a world where quality matters, it's reassuring to know that I'm consuming a product that meets the highest standards of purity and sustainability.

Jeremysha,Good so far,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2023","ive only been taking these for about a week and i havent noticed or felt any different especially being as though it is just a vitamin. However i will say i have tried soooo many prenatals in the last 3 years on my TTC journey from target brand, one a day, walmart brand, walgreens brand, spring valley, conceive easy, pink stork, mary ruths and many more and this brand is definitely in my top 5 of just over all healthy, cleaner prenatals. Some make me constipated, some gives headaches, some makes me nauseous and i just have no had these issues with this one. it is pricey but it also feels like a good quality prenatal. i also buy these to have on hand especially since i am TTC and have been for so long and this one for sure will be one that i add to my monthly shopping list.",3 people found this helpful

Daneille Jones,The reason that I like Garden of Life Prenatal ...,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2023","is because it's not just any ordinary prenatal vitamin. It's a superhero in disguise, fighting off morning sickness and keeping me feeling great throughout my pregnancy. This vitamin is Non-GMO Project Verified, so I know I'm getting the best quality ingredients for myself and my baby. Plus, it's gluten-free and kosher, so it fits into my dietary restrictions with ease. The neural development support from iron, folate, and vitamins C and D3 gives me peace of mind, knowing that my baby's brain is getting all the nutrients it needs. And let's not forget about the added bonus of probiotics for immune support. This vitamin truly has it all! It's like having a personal nutritionist in a bottle. I can't recommend Garden of Life Prenatal Multivitamin enough. Say goodbye to nausea and hello to a healthy and happy pregnancy with this amazing product!",10 people found this helpful

inthenow,"Damaged packaging, foul taste",,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2023","Like another reviewer, I received the first bottle and it was totally shattered inside the packaging. I got the second bottle delivered, and the a lot of powder (that the capsules are filled with) was at the bottom of the bottle. As a result, the powdered covered every single capsule. The flavor is foul - fishy and unpleasant. Probably even more intolerable when you’re pregnant and sensitive to everything. I didn’t want to deal with trying to get a third bottle delivered so I moved to a different brand. I don’t recommend.",One person found this helpful
Chelsea Shaw,Prenatal Multivitamin: An Essential Companion f...,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2023","I really like the features of the Garden of Life Prenatal Multivitamin for Women with Iron, Folate & Vitamin C and D3 for Neural Development & Probiotics for Immune Support. As a mom-to-be, I want nothing but the best for my baby, and this product delivers on that front. The neural development support it provides is truly remarkable, ensuring that my little one gets the nutrients needed for their brain development. Plus, the comprehensive multi-nutrient formula covers all the bases, giving me peace of mind that I'm getting everything I need during this crucial time. And let's not forget about the over 20 fruits and veggies packed into each serving! It's like a garden in a bottle, providing me with a natural source of vitamins and minerals.

Merys Lorena Rojas,Empty capsules,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2023","I decided to switch to this multivitamin at the end of my pregnancy but I think I did wrong. It didn’t work for me. You need to take 3 pills a day and I like to do it all at once because then I will forget. Annnd I got a lot heartburn guess because of that (not sure). They also have a strong smell but natural. And the most in usual was to find a broken capsule and a empty one. This is my review and my experience. Maybe this can work for you, you just need to try it 🤷🏻‍♀️",N/A
Trista,Don't recommend for those this bad morning sickness,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023",Garden of Life is my go to brand for vitamins so when I found out I was pregnant I immediately bought these. I vomited them up everytime I tried to take them. They were way too hard on my stomach. Not to mention you're supposed to take 4 of them throughout the day so I was pretty much constantly nauseated. It's just too much when you're likely already experiencing a sensitive stomach. But I gave them to my friend and she likes them so gave them some stars back for credit since some women can miraculously stomach these. Just would not recommend for those of us who have a lot of upset stomach from baby.,One person found this helpful

Daniel Weirick,"Less nausea, more energy!",,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2023","I switched to this prenatal about halfway through my pregnancy and noticed a huge difference! My old prenatals were making me nauseous, but these actually helped my nausea and I finally felt my energy come back! The smell and taste are unpleasant, so I would recommend taking these while holding your breath or with some juice. You also have to take three per day, which isn’t a big deal once you get into the habit of it. Nutrition is super important during pregnancy, especially if you have morning sickness and unable to eat a balanced diet. I highly recommend these!",10 people found this helpful

jab296,AMAZING results to help with menstrual issues,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2023","I am 37, and starting about 5 or so years ago I started having regular spotting or bleeding between my cycles, as well as bleeding after intimate relations, which got so bad the past 2 years or so that I was basically spotting or bleeding every day all month long almost every month. I began taking these daily, and noticed slow but steady improvement within a month. Within 3 months, my bleeding and spotting between periods was all but gone! I have been taking these regularly for a little over a year, and any time I slack on it by going too many days without taking it in the month, the spotting comes back. I usually only take 2 a day, sometimes one, but that is enough. This vitamin is seriously amazing. I recommended it to my older sister that also had spotting issues, and she noticed a positive difference as well. HIGHLY 100% RECOMMEND!!",6 people found this helpful
